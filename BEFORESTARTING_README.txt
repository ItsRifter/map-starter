This template is used to start map projects.

This contains the necessary structure in maps but you may not be using all of them
in that case, you are free to remove them.

in folders where a "raw" folder is there, that is used to keep any raw file
mp4, obj, jpg would go into the appropriate folder.

This helps keep folders clean of clutter
